# 8-Puzzle-Problem-Solution

Hello, Welcome to my world.

There are a lot of solutions of this 8 tiles puzzle problem with A* and other very complex algorithms.

But in here, I tried my own approach to solve this problem without any complex algorithms, just using 'Misplaced Tiles' heuristic function and 'Manhattan Distance' heuristic function.

After completion, it turned out to be more efficient than traditional algorithms that are used to solve this problem previously. What a charm! Even I didn's expected that much efficiency.

After all, a 21 hours of programming in a single sitting paid off :D
